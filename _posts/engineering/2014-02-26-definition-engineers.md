title: 'DEFINITION: Engineers'
author: Tom
category: engineering
excerpt: An Engineer is a creator. Someone who is able to breathe life into an idea. Someone who takes thoughts and makes them reality. To be a creator takes skills in many dimensions&#58; deep technical skill, ability to code fast with quality, deep customer empathy, ability to inspire a team, ability to design UX, ability to get users to adopt a product, ability to set & manage business metrics... This is our standard for an engineer. Most organizations have a very limited view of engineers – they ship code. They are deeply technical but that is all. This is not an Engineer. Next Jump Engineers take ideas and breathe life into them, build business out of them, create products that people actually use.
