excerpt: Failure in communication happens when people don’t know what to do, what to say, don’t know the solution, don’t even understand the problem...  When you don’t communicate, when you don’t respond... you are responding. The person on the other end fills in the blank. “you don’t care”... ”you don’t agree”... “you’re just incompetent and have no regard for others”... everyone and every situation has a different blank or blanks filled…but there is a real cost. It is not free.

Failure in communication happens when people don’t know what to do, what to say, don’t know the solution, don’t even understand the problem...

When you don’t communicate, when you don’t respond... you are responding. The person on the other end fills in the blank. “you don’t care”... ”you don’t agree”... “you’re just incompetent and have no regard for others”... everyone and every situation has a different blank or blanks filled…but there is a real cost. It is not free.
