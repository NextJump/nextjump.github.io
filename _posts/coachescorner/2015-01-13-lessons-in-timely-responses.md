Failure in communication happens when people are faced with a problem and they don’t know what to do, what to say, what the solution is, or even the full nature of the problem.

When you don’t communicate, when you don’t respond, you are still sending a message. The person on the other end fills in the blank. “You don’t care; you don’t agree; you’re just incompetent and have no regard for others.” Everyone and every situation has a different subject for that blank, and there is a real cost to filling it with the wrong answer. It is not free to ignore a communication, so relate your thinking in order to prevent them from operating on bad assumptions.
