Coaching Guidelines

The best universities have the best teachers. The process of hiring and developing the best teachers over time is the single biggest advantage they hold.

We have found this to be very similar for a Company. The best companies hire and develop the best Coaches. We've also found the best students (humble mindset vs. expert/know-it-all) need to practice coaching in order to advance their learning as a student.

To that end, this is our v1 Coaching Guidelines:

1. AWARENESS (Thought):

    1. Bad = when the suffering begins. The minute we determine something is bad, we are paralyzed by fear & self-consciousness. We need to re-orient "bad" to become opportunities to practice through difficulty.
    2. ID when our mental models are broken (helping to eliminate our thematic repeated errors). We often apply a solution regardless of the situation. As a result we train all leaders to practice always reading the situation on a daily and weekly basis. For instance: we found people who were being OBTUSE thought they were practicing GRIT.

2. PRACTICE (Action):

    1. Consistent Little Things (daily and weekly rituals) .The key to successful practice and ultimately lasting change is to create rituals and behaviors that are repeatable realistically on a daily and weekly basis [CONSISTENCY]. As most things are doable on an INTENSE level but not repeatable. For instance: MSD (make someone's day: random acts of kindness), trying to accomplish 5 acts per week was unsustainable (1 per day) but at twice a week, rituals happened.
    2. Point of Failure = your starting point for training. In physical fitness, trainers will make you lift weights until the point of failure to determine where to begin training. We've found a similar framework to be applied for all training, especially in Consistency training.
