excerpt: The best universities have the best teachers. The process of hiring and developing the best teachers over time is the single biggest advantage they hold. We have found this to be very similar for a Company. The best companies hire and develop the best Coaches. We've also found the best students (humble mindset vs. expert/know-it-all) need to practice coaching in order to advance their learning as a student. To that end, this is our v1 Coaching Guidelines&#58;

The best universities have the best teachers. The process of hiring and developing the best teachers over time is the single biggest advantage they hold. 

We have found this to be very similar for a Company. The best companies hire and develop the best Coaches. We've also found the best students, those with a humble mindset as opposed to a know-it-all attitude, need to practice coaching in order to advance their learning as a student.

To that end, we are sharing the first iteration of our Coaching Guidelines:

1. AWARENESS (Thought):

    1. The moment we characterize something as bad is when our mental suffering begins. That is the point when we are paralyzed by fear & self-consciousness. We need to re-orient "bad" situations as opportunities to practice through difficulty.
    2. Identify when our mental models of how a process works are broken, which will help to eliminate repeated systemic errors. We often apply a solution regardless of the situation, and as a result we strive to train all leaders to practice always reading the situation on a daily and weekly basis. For instance: we found people who thought they were being persistent were actually failing to recognize when their approach just wasn’t working.

2. PRACTICE (Action):

    1. Consistent Little Things (daily and weekly rituals). The key to successful practice and ultimately lasting change is to create rituals and behaviors that are realistic and repeatable on a daily and weekly basis [CONSISTENCY]. As most things are doable on an INTENSE level but not repeatable. For instance: in the Make Someone’s Day initiative we encouraged people to find a stranger they could help out.. Trying to accomplish 5 acts per week was unsustainable, but at twice a week it was achievable and eventually became a ritual for those who made an effort to be consistent.
    2. Point of Failure = your starting point for training. In physical fitness, trainers will make you lift weights until the point of failure to determine where to begin training. We've found a similar framework to be applied for all training, especially in Consistency training.
