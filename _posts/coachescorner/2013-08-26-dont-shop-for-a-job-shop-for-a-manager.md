There's a common notion that “people join companies but leave managers”.

The engineer in me says, if that’s the case, let’s solve for that. Don’t take a job b/c of the company, instead take a job b/c it’s the right manager.

Common questions for companies:
How is the company doing?
What is the strategy?
What is the org chart?

Replace to interview managers:
How much have you grown in the last 12 months \[better me\]?
Who did you grow in the last 12 months \[better you\]?

Don’t shop for a job. Shop for a manager.

Job: product/title/salary

Manager: teacher/coach/mentor
