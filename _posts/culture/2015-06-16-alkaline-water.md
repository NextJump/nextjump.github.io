<b>What are the benefits of alkaline water?</b>

General hydration is an important component to overall health. Dehydration can affect energy levels, performance, and concentration. It is important to drink enough water to allow your body to function at its best. The general rule is approx. eight 8-ounce glasses of water per day but depending on height, weight, activity level and climate you may need more. Alkaline water is a great choice because not only does it help you stay hydrated but it offers additional health benefits.

Our bodies have a natural pH that is slightly alkaline and for optimal health our diets should focus on promoting alkalinity and decreasing acidity. Alkaline water helps our bodies in this way as it has a high pH (9.5) with electrolytes that are critical to maintaining normal blood pressure, focus, proper cardiac rhythm, muscle strength, and intestinal function. Studies suggest that alkaline water can neutralize acid in your bloodstream, boost your metabolism and help your body absorb nutrients more effectively. 

Foods such as meat, dairy, grains, and processed sugar can cause acidic waste to build up in our body so by focusing on fresh fruits, vegetables (see list below) and adding alkaline water to our diets, we can rebalance our bodies.
