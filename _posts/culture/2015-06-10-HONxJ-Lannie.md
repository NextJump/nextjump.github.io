Lannie is one of the QA engineers in the New York office.  After her amazing results from her <a href = "https://www.nextjump.com/people">10X</a> presentation earlier this year, we asked her about the people in her life who have helped and inspired her.

<b>How did you feel coming out of 10X?</b>

Totally surprised.  My mindset going in was “I’m going to do my best,” but I didn’t expect anything like that.  I surprised myself.  Afterwards, I did a reflection about how I’ve grown and read through all the feedback to see what things I can do more of.

<b>So what is that thing you can do more?</b>

In 10X, I had circumstances that showed my growth but going forward, I think I need more of a daily ritual.  And I want to convert all the things I learned from my experiences in recruiting to the revenue side.  Sometimes my work projects can be out of my comfort zone.

<b>Who at Next Jump has helped you pick up the skills to grow into your role?</b>

I would say Pushkar.  He built all the release tools and so he’s taught me a lot about that.  For example, we’re building a dashboard for code review, and Pushkar will have sessions with me about the Zen framework.  I’ve learned a lot from him about working with new knowledge.

<b>Who in your life inspires you?</b>

My dad.  Maybe it’s more traditional, but I listen to his advice and I fully trust him.  Before 10th grade, I never thought of studying abroad.  He brought it up as an option.  When I was deciding majors – for UK universities, you have to decide your major and can’t change it.  At that time, I loved physics, so I initially chose electrical engineering.  Later on, I changed it because my interests diverged.  So he was the one I went to.
