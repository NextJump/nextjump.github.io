title: Admitting You&apos;re Lost
author: Elise
category: culture
excerpt: When I first started at Next Jump, I would never admit that I was confused, or didn&apos;t follow, or was lost.  I would leave a meeting with a colleague, teammate, or even our CEO having no clue what to do next. I&apos;d find myself paralyzed.  They expected something big, and they expected it to be done right, but I had no idea where to even begin. I would put off tasks and projects for hours, days, even weeks.  Nothing changed, and nothing happened. I was stuck and miserable.  And worst of all, I wasn&apos;t growing.  Fast forward to today – I feel myself growing more than I ever have before.

How many times have you found yourself in a meeting that you aren&apos;t following?  

Depending on your character strength (humble v. confident) you may be honest with yourself about how frequently that happens or you might tell yourself it is a rare occurrence. Regardless, everyone finds themselves in this situation at one point or another.

Now how many times do you voice the fact that you&apos;re lost and not following the conversation? 

When I first started at Next Jump, I would never admit that I was confused, or didn&apos;t follow, or was lost.  I would leave a meeting with a colleague, teammate, or even our CEO having no clue what to do next. I&apos;d find myself paralyzed.  They expected something big, and they expected it to be done right, but I had no idea where to even begin. I would put off tasks and projects for hours, days, even weeks.  Nothing changed, and nothing happened. I was stuck and miserable.  And worst of all, I wasn&apos;t growing.

Fast forward to today – I feel myself growing more than I ever have before. One of the biggest tools I attribute to the growth I&apos;ve experienced at Next Jump is the ability to admit that I&apos;m lost, accepting that, and then making a &ldquo;bad&rdquo; version.  Recently, I was having a conversation with our CEO about Next Jump Academy, a huge project I&apos;ve been given ownership of.  We were launching our first session that very day and I was updating Charlie with the status.  He dived into wisdom and advice, how we could make it better…and I was NOT following. &ldquo;ID the real problem,&rdquo; &ldquo;find patterns,&rdquo; &ldquo;we want to truly help individuals who are attending.&rdquo;  From what I picked up, I knew what he was saying was important, but I had no idea how to actually take this advice and act on it.

&ldquo;Sound good?&rdquo;   Charlie asks.

Internal panic. How could I say I didn&apos;t follow? Will he judge me, does he think I&apos;m not qualified, will he take me off the project?  All these doubts raced through my mind. But I went against instinct and did what I&apos;ve learned is so valuable: &ldquo;I&apos;ll be honest Charlie, you lost me there.&rdquo; 

&ldquo;I expect you to get stuck, just try and put something together and we can review later.&rdquo;

It&apos;s funny because there was definitely a relief in saying &ldquo;I don&apos;t know/you lost me&rdquo; out loud.  Once I said it, I felt better and then his response helped me even more.  It un-paralyzed me. His response told me that whatever I come up with can be bad, but a start is better than pretending I was following and knew what to do. Without admitting that I was lost I would have had to come up with something good, or mostly right, and that would have paralyzed me.
 
It&apos;s silly to ever pretend like you know because the whole point of growing is that you&apos;re venturing into the unknown. It&apos;s easy to get stuck pretending and to be afraid of failure, but failure is really the very thing that helps us grow.

There is a mantra that I keep at my desk, to push me to try:

SOMETHING BAD IS BETTER THAN NOTHING. SOMETHING BAD IS EASIER TO MAKE BETTER.

So if you&apos;re like me, I encourage you to just get the first version out and +1 it.
