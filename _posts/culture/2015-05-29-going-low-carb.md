Many of us are trying to get healthier and improve our numbers – cleaning up our diets by cutting down on carbohydrates (and processed foods) is one great way to do this.

1.	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KA3ejdkS_v0", target="_blank"><b>The first few days of cutting down on carbs are the hardest.</b></a> After eating low carb for a while you’ll find that you won’t want bread, rice, pasta, grains.
<br>
2.	<b>Eat foods to fill you up.</b> Broccoli is the secret weapon. Eat anything that you have to chew a lot. You never should be hungry (stay in the Happy Zone!). There are generally 2 foods that fill you up: (1) Foods you have to chew a lot (2) Heavy foods – literally heavy. Think an apple versus chips. Fiber fills you up.
<br>
3.	<b>Protein is king.</b> Good fat is second; it is good for the brain and keeps you sharp. Any carbs in your diet should come from veggies.
<br>
4.	<b>4.	Be careful of hidden sugar in anything.</b> A salad is great but does the dressing have a glaze or sugar? Same with any other prepared dish. It’s not the dish that is usually the problem. It is the flavorings they put in it.
<br>
5.	<b>Sleep!</b> The more you sleep, the less hungry you will be.
<br>
6.	Get in the habit of <b>looking at the back of things</b> if you haven’t already. In restaurants, google through “my fitness pal” the nutrition content of food. Be careful of sauces!  The New York Times has a great interactive piece about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/04/27/upshot/How-to-Eat-Healthy-Meals-at-Restaurants.html", target="_blank">how you can do this.</a>
