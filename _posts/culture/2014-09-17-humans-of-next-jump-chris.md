<b>What's a proud moment that you have experienced?</b>
 
I did a mathematics and statistics degree. Until the age of 18 and going to university I had found academics relatively straight forward, I just went along with the process. Suddenly when I got to university it was a different type of thing, and I didn’t like not knowing the answers. I didn’t like thinking that I was not in the top X% of the class, and so after halfway through my first year I thought, ‘This isn’t for me’. I was scared. My natural reaction to that was to give up. Looking back, I realize that was how I handled a lot of things in my life. I can think of so many situations where I gave something up because it became too difficult or I wasn’t naturally gifted at it. I refer back to this situation a lot as through changing my perception and identifying an opportunity to improve myself, I was able to push through wanting to quit. The end result was a few years where I worked my butt off and ended up graduating at the top of my class. I look at the moment I graduated as a proud one, not because of the results I achieved, but what it represented from start to finish and the realization that I had been the one limiting my potential. At Next Jump I’ve found myself falling back to my old way of thinking at times and have been working on identifying exactly what drives this in order to correct it. Overcoming the negative thoughts and recognizing how I react when something isn’t going the right way has made this moment a good reference point for me.
 
<b>Who's helped you? Who are you thankful for?</b>
 
Tarun has helped me out a lot at Next Jump, without a doubt. We have known each other for five or six years now, long before Next Jump. I have a lot of respect for him and everything he’s achieved here. He’s one of the very few people who will call me out quite openly on everything, and I invite that with him. He’s helped me reframe my thinking a lot and as a result had the biggest influence on me. Not just at Next Jump, but in general, really. I think I’ve been lucky in that I’ve always known that he’s got my back. Coming into your first job out of university, not everyone has that and I did, and that has helped me along the way. It’s also created an open dialogue between him and me, which you might not get for new hires. It’s like that awkward phase sort of like when you’re dating, where you never really say what you think.
 
<b>Is there something that you think is unique to the UK office?</b>
 
As a small office, we’re incredibly close. I think travelling together for the Next Jump Holiday Party and Summer Outing has an impact on that. All over the UK office, we’re very mixed in terms of our nationalities: Australian, Lithuanian, Greek, Irish, British, …. That definitely adds a bit of flavor to what we do and how we do it. Next Jump is great for this because there are so many opportunities to share backgrounds and establish commonalities; whether that’s someone hosting a Coronitas celebrating their culture or an interesting speech during Toastmasters about someone’s life before Next Jump. The end result is a closer team, a closer family.
 
<b>Is there some advice that you would give to new hires (or anyone in general)?</b>
 
So my advice… it’s funny because I was asked this by a new hire last week. It’s to always look for an opportunity in weakness, but also don’t take what’s been given to you or what’s been done before as what you should do. See it as an opportunity to learn from what’s happened, create a vision where you can impove yourself along the way and most importantly, leave your mark on it.
