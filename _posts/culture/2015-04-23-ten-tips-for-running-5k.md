1.	<b>Proper footwear is key!</b> You can save energy, decrease your chances of injury, feel better while you run and perform better with the right shoes for your body. Here at Next Bump, we have a gait analysis device, Optogait that can measure your stride step by step and tell you if your sneakers are appropriate for you.
<br>
2.	<b>Commit to a program.</b> Follow a training schedule and document what you have done. Log your distance, time and speed and stick to a consistent schedule. By adhering to a routine and documenting your runs you can make alterations in your training if need be. In addition a log can be extremely motivating. Every time you stick to the plan and journal it you have hit a goal!! This will encourage you as you countdown to race day.
<br>
3.	<b>Eat healthy!</b> Exercising is a stress. The proper fuel will help keep your energy up for a run and help your body recover by replenishing what it needs. You do not need Doritos but you need vitamin C. Opt for unprocessed carbohydrates like fruits, veggies, whole grains and legumes.
<br>
4.	<b>Build up your endurance.</b> Make sure your training does not start off to aggressively. You will incrementally increase everything (distance/speed).  Pace yourself. You may need to slow down to a walk. It is more important to get through your “runs”  at a slower more comfortable level of exertion than overtraining and burning out (a sure fire way to not accomplish your goal). * Run outside! Perhaps the weather doesn’t permit a run outdoors. A few treadmill runs are okay, but your outdoor running endurance is dependent on outdoor running.
<br>
5.	</b>Always warm up.</b> Much like #4. Go slow, your body needs to adapt to the work you expect of it. On race day warming up is also recommended. Your warm up, need NOT include stretching. Stretching comes after your muscular tissue is warm and more elastic. If you so choose, stretch after your warm up...or your run!
<br>
6.	<b>Partner up.</b> Support can make your run feel less difficult by decreasing our pain sensation. Also accountability can keep you on track (pun intended) with your programming and motivate you to work harder to not let your partner/ running group down.
<br>
7.	<b>Strength train to compliment your running.</b> Strengthening muscles can give you more endurance during a run and help you sustain better posture during your runs. Strength train after a rest day or a light run. Also do not strength train to hard before a run and deplete yourself before race training.
<br>
8.	<b>Rest.</b> We are only as strong as we recover. Better sleep, decreasing emotional and physical stresses wherever possible are keys to stamina in life and accordingly for your race day and training days.
<br>
9.	<b>Hydrate.</b> The longer you work out the more you may require hydration beyond water to replenish electrolytes such as potassium, sodium and calcium to name a few. Coconut water and Emergency C packs are great low sugar options.
<br>
10.	<b>Make it FUN!!!</b> What is fun for you?? Competing with a friend? Listening to music or a book on tape? Running with your pet? Find what you love doing and you will be more likely to stick to it!
