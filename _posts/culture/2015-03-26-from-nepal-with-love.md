These girls come from poor circumstances, with either a single mother or father, or no parents at all. Others have parents who are handicapped or disabled. The girls all come from poor or illiterate families. They all fall into the “high risk” category for being married off at a young age or being sent away as domestic servants. Others have to work in hotels or by dry riverbeds to earn a living for their family. These girls are the first of their generation to be educated and literate.  That’s where She’s the First aims to help!  At Kopila Valley, we fund an all-inclusive yearly package for everything a girl needs to go to school. enabling them to achieve greater things and a better life than their circumstances might otherwise allow.

"Site visits like this one are a crucial part of what we do,” said Christen Brandt, STF Co-founder and Director of International Operations. “It helps us to strengthen partner relationships, gain an in-depth knowledge of on-the-ground programs, and collect the images and stories that help us achieve our mission all year long."

From our Nepal trip this month, we've got a special treat for Next Jumpers!  Watch this video:
