<b>Who’s made a significant impact on you and your growth during the past five years?</b>
 
Jackie’s been one of those people.  She was my mentor during the first class of <a href="http://www.nextjump.com/about/mentorship" target="_blank">Project Padawan</a>.  Up until then I hadn’t had as many chances to work directly with her, but she made an effort to include me in calls and meetings, to always have an open door for me.  Later, I had the opportunity to captain Project Padawan and then have a mentee – it was awesome to see the whole thing come full circle.
 
<b>What’s one of your most impactful memories?</b>
 
I don’t know if this is related to your question but Mitchell’s <a href="https://www.nextjump.com/about/tenxfactor" target="_blank">10X</a> presentation came to mind.  I led his Situational Workshop for a while.  I remember, after he gave his 10X presentation – he’d gotten some of the highest scores anybody had gotten at that point – and afterwards he came and gave me a hug.  That meant a lot to me.
 
<b>What does five years at Next Jump mean to you?</b>
 
I feel like Next Jump years should be measured like dog years, multiple everything by two.  Five years feels like ten years, with how much you learn every day.
 
<b>What’s changed the most since day 1 and today?</b>
 
I think the biggest change I’ve noticed is that there’s a lot more focus and awareness on the individual, on trying to notice patterns in what you do and say, “I’m going to try something new today.”  Everybody from top to bottom, different teams, even the trainers, are keyed in on that.

Lately, I’m working on speaking up, especially in moments where I may not be 100% prepared, and also taking more ownership.  The merchant team used to be a lot bigger, we used to take up this entire side of the 8th floor.  So as the team has changed and my role has grown, I’m getting more and more opportunities to do that.  Earlier I worked on the charity side with different organizations, and that gave me confidence early on, that I could approach new areas that maybe I didn’t have previous experience with – that experience showed me how to run towards a problem.
