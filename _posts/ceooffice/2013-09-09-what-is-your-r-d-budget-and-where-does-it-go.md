In the recent past I have invited increasingly more Next Jump visitors to take part in our “culture tour,” literally touring the office to view the hundreds of signs, posters and photos that illustrate the way we invest in our culture. I receive the same two questions over and over which has naturally lead me answer them better over time. I want to share the answers with you. The diagram below illustrates the point I’m about to make.

### Question #1: When do you guys do work? (implying we have so much culture stuff taking all of our employees time)

Answer: Culture is our work. Culture is an investment in our people (their growth & development). This is where our R&D investments go. We consider this R&D because we are experimenting all the time with how to develop our people, leaders who can solve the world’s biggest problems.

The process of investing in our people creates an outcome of revenue…our fuel to fund more culture. Most companies invest their R&D $ in products. We invest our R&D $ towards our human capital, our most important asset.

By the way this becomes obvious by all the examples visitors see on the walls which include 40 culture initiatives for our employees to “practice” their leadership skills.


### Question #2: Where did all this come from?

Answer: It's an investment we started years ago during early days of the business (when there were a handful of employees). And the magic ingredient wasn’t $, it was CARE. However we found that the culture really took off when the business started creating "reserves" (the revenue fuel) - the breathing room to allow us to experiment more aggressively on leadership development: this is our R&D budget.

It’s people who create business results.  When they are being developed (learning, growing, motivated) they make better judgment calls and give it their all.  So we invest in the leading metric = our people.


#### So why don’t more companies do this?

The Top 2 reasons we hear:

We are too small, we can’t afford it 
We are too big, it’s too hard to make this kind of cultural shift
Our response, we were also small once, and by the way, we are still small relative to “big” companies, but at what point should you start?

Well you should ask yourself the question, what is the most important asset in your company? Your products may drive short term revenue, and you need to be deliberate and responsible about maximizing revenues (the fuel you need), however in the long term, will that be sustainable or are you running a treadmill to keep your employees, clients, and investors happy?

Isn’t it true that companies that invest in R&D in general see it pay off in the long term?


#### What is it doing for us? What are the results?

We are seeing it pay off in the short and long term. In the short term we are exceeding revenue goals for almost 4 consecutive quarters in a row. In the long term we are seeing a difference in our people. They are making better judgment calls, and improving the business in ways we as management could never have dreamed.

Our employees and board continue to ask us: Why are the revenue numbers so successful? We asked them: Why are NxJumpers (our employees) so motivated? The answer is simple: It is b/c we are investing in them as people. 

We aren’t suggesting companies find new investment $$ but rather to shift their existing R&D investments, even a small % to start, towards your people.
